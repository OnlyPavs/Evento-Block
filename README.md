## Introduction
EventChain is a blockchain-based platform designed to streamline the organization and management of events. Using blockchain technology's inherent security and transparency, EventChain ensures that all event-related data is tamper-proof and verifiable.

## Features
- **Decentralized Platform**: Eliminates the need for a central authority, reducing the risk of fraud and corruption.
- **Secure Transactions**: Ensures all transactions (e.g., ticket sales, payments) are secure and transparent.
- **Immutable Records**: All event data is stored on the blockchain, making it immutable and auditable.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates ticket issuance, payments, and attendee verification processes.
- **User Roles**:
  - **Organizer**: Creates and manages events.
  - **Event**: Represents the actual event with its details.
  - **Attendee**: Registers and participates in events.

## Architecture
EventChain consists of the following core components:
1. **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity, these contracts handle the creation and management of events and the registration of attendees.
2. **Blockchain**: The Ethereum blockchain is used to deploy and run the smart contracts.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Truffle (for deploying smart contracts)
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eventoblock.git
    cd eventoblock
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile Smart Contracts**:
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
    ```bash
    truffle migrate
    ```

## Usage
1. **Organizer**:
   - Create a new event.
   - Set event details such as date, time, location, and ticket price.
   - Manage attendee registrations and payments.

2. **Event**:
   - View event details.
   - List of registered attendees.
   - Real-time updates on event status.

3. **Attendee**:
   - Register for events.
   - Purchase tickets.
   - Verify registration status.
